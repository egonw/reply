# Reply to 'A faster path to an open future'
By Egon Willighagen, 12-?? May 2019

Dear Steven Inchcoombe,

Thank you for announcing that SpringerNature wants to speed up its effort towards an open future.
As Editor-in-Chief of one of your 100% CC-BY journals [0], I welcome this. At the same time, I
will try to reply to your piece and with that outline some of my ideas of what SpringerNature
needs to aim for. This will be partly based on your piece [1], my presentation at SpringerNature
HQ in London last autumn [2], and our own feedback to Plan S [3]. My write up here, is my personal,
researcher perspective. Writing this up will take me time; we have a lot to discuss.
