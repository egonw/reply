# Reply to 'A faster path to an open future'
By Egon Willighagen, 12-?? May 2019

Dear Steven Inchcoombe,

Thank you for announcing that SpringerNature wants to speed up its effort towards an open future.
As Editor-in-Chief of one of your 100% CC-BY journals [0], I welcome this. At the same time, I
will try to reply to your piece and with that outline some of my ideas of what SpringerNature
needs to aim for. This will be partly based on your piece [1], my presentation at SpringerNature
HQ in London last autumn [2], and our own feedback to Plan S [3]. My write up here, is my personal,
researcher perspective. Writing this up will take me time; we have a lot to discuss.

The opening sentence is, in my opinion, where it goes wrong: "At Springer Nature we want to find
the fastest and most effective route to immediate open access (OA) for all primary research."
It sounds wonderful. But it also sounds shallow. Of course, it's business talk, buzz words, etc.
And that makes it shallow. This is not a vision, not a mission. It's something to keep the authors
and funders happy.

My questions start at the first three words: Springer Nature is a large company, with at least
two sections: Nature Publishing Group doing the paywall journals, fully and partly. The latter
often called a milder hybrid journal, but it still employs a paywall. If you want to find Open
Access fast, you simply pay attention the BMC branch of SpringerNature. You do not have to
search a fast route, you already found it a few years ago. You spent money on buying the fast
route.

Of course, what you mean is, how can we ensure a non-disruptive route for the closed journals.
The sentence claims to be for all primary research, but I think you mean for research that
people want to publish in glossy journals.

The whole idea that some journals are expensive because you need to reject so many articles,
is a self-fulfilling profecy you opted in for: these "prestiguous" journals have a long
history of boosting impact factors (like the campain for Nature, where a personal subscription
costed only as much as the impact factor). By cherrishing "prestiguous" you created an
artificial shortage. You do not have to reject 90% of the articles; you only need to reject
bad articles.

Second, after almost 20 years of Open Access, saying that SpringerNature needs to find a
solution, makes me wonder what the company has been doing (or not doing) in those 20 years.

That gets me to my next point, why this opening sentence is horribly wrong.
